As a Portfolio Manager, assessing the performance of your main portfolio relative to the hedge portfolio is critical to understanding true alpha (performance not explained by the hedge), risk-adjusted returns, and hedge effectiveness. Here's how to approach it step-by-step:

‚úÖ 1. Set the Objective
Ask yourself:

Is the hedge meant to neutralize market exposure (e.g. beta hedging)?

Or sector/style risks (e.g. long growth stocks, short value stocks)?

Or individual security/issuer risks?

‚úÖ 2. Calculate Performance of Both
Compute daily/weekly/monthly P&L or returns for both:

Main Portfolio Return = (P_t - P_0 + Dividends) / P_0
Hedge Portfolio Return = (H_t - H_0) / H_0
Net Portfolio Return = Main Portfolio Return - Hedge Return
‚úÖ 3. Compare Performance: Net of Hedge
Track Net P&L or Net Return:

Net Performance = P&L_Main - P&L_Hedge
This shows whether your alpha bets or idiosyncratic positions are working.

‚úÖ 4. Check Correlation & Beta
Run a regression of your portfolio return vs. hedge return:

Rp = Œ± + Œ≤ * Rh + Œµ
Where:

Œ≤: hedge sensitivity (ideally ~1 for full hedge)

Œ±: excess return (your true alpha)

Œµ: residual (unexplained noise/return)

A low R¬≤ means poor hedge; high alpha + low beta = strong performance.

‚úÖ 5. Visualize Performance
Plot Cumulative Returns of:

Main portfolio

Hedge portfolio

Net (Main ‚Äì Hedge)

Use rolling beta and tracking error charts

Evaluate drawdowns and volatility

‚úÖ 6. Risk-Adjusted Metrics (Net of Hedge)
Calculate:

Sharpe Ratio (Net Return / Volatility)

Sortino Ratio (Downside risk-adjusted)

Information Ratio (Net Return / Tracking Error)

‚úÖ 7. Stress Tests & Scenarios
Check how both portfolios behave in stress events.

If both go down together, your hedge may be incomplete or correlated with your main book.

‚úÖ 8. Attribution Analysis
Break Net Performance into:

Stock Selection (did picks outperform peers?)

Timing (were entries/exits effective?)

Sector/Factor Exposures (did your long-short ideas work?)

üîç Example:
If you're long $10M in tech stocks and short $10M in NASDAQ futures:

If NASDAQ drops 5% and your portfolio drops 4%, you've outperformed by +1% net of hedge.

But if your beta was <1, you're not fully hedged.

Final Thought:
True performance is in the residuals. A good hedge neutralizes systematic risk, revealing your true investment skill.

Let me know if you want this in a spreadsheet or Python script.


Absolutely ‚Äî this line of code is running a linear regression of your Short portfolio returns against your Hedge basket returns, and the summary() output gives you deep insights into hedge effectiveness, alpha, and exposure.

Where:

Short_t = daily return of short basket

Hedge_t = daily return of hedge basket

Œ± (Intercept) = performance not explained by hedge (aka "alpha")

Œ≤ (Slope) = how sensitive your short basket is to the hedge

Œµ_t = residual (noise)

üìÑ What the Output Means (from model.summary())
‚úÖ Key Output Fields:
Metric	Interpretation
coef (const)	Your alpha ‚Äî average return not explained by the hedge. A positive alpha means your short basket is underperforming your hedge (bad for market-neutral), or you're earning excess returns (if you're net long the hedge).
coef (Hedge)	Your beta ‚Äî how much your short basket moves with the hedge basket. Ideally, close to -1 if you want full hedge symmetry.
R-squared	% of variation in the short basket that is explained by the hedge. Closer to 1 = good hedge; close to 0 = ineffective hedge.
**P>	t
Standard Error	Variability in the coefficient estimate. Smaller is better.
F-statistic / Prob (F)	Tests overall significance of regression (i.e., is this model meaningful?).
